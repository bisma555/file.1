   <h2>THE KEY TO SUCCESS</h2>
   <h3>By Bisma Mustafa</h3>
   <P>The very first key to success is to make a plan.
    This means having a clear picture of what a successful life looks like to you and
     putting together a well-defined set of goals to get you to that life.
     Planning well starts with figuring out what you want and writing it down in detail.
     With Self-Discipline, Almost Anything is Possible.
      Theodore Roosevelt once said, “With self-discipline, almost anything is possible.”
       Self-discipline is, indeed, regarded as one of the keys to success.
      Many people attribute self-discipline as having determination and fortitude.
      True success means staying true to a deeper sense of purpose,
       despite deviating from a superficial social norm. It means finding joy in suffering.
       It means having the courage to peruse one's own journey when confronted by
        the fear of uncertainty.</P>

        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <P>The aim high meaning refers to setting goals and dreams for yourself. 
            Ferriss encouraging 
            aiming high instead of choosing dreams you think are reasonable.
            setting high expectations for yourself can be the catalyst that propels 
            you to greater heights. By aiming high, you challenge yourself
             to go beyond your perceived limits and discover your true potential.
             The AIM acronym stands for ADVOCACY, INSPIRATION and MENTORSHIP, and
              by pairing groups of teens with different leaders and advocates in our
               community each week, we encourage meaningful dialogues and 
               thought-provoking conversations
              in order to inspire these types of mentoring relationships.</P>
